They're below the target range less of the time in the hard scenario. This suggests that, in the easy scenario, participants tend to keep FiO2 higher than they should. This could be an artifact of the scenario design, or it could point to a tendency to overestimate oxygenation needs. Note that, in the hard scenario, the target range is the maximum possible, so we can't say whether overestimation differs by scenario difficulty.\n",
